HTML - Hyper-Link Markup Language

What is HTML?
  HTML is a markup language which you can use to create web pages, along with Javascript and CSS (Cascade Style Sheets).

Why would someone use HTML when they could use Wix or Webnode?
  Because you have to pay to remove the watermarks, and you can choose your own domain name (not yet though, we'll get there, don't worry).

What is a domain?
  The domain is the name the internet servers store your website by. Your domain can be website.wix.com, which has the Wix watermark.
  Or you can have website.com, which has no Wix watermark in it.
  Which do you want?

What do I need to make a website?
  A computer with access to the Internet for this tutorial.

Let's Get Started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to codehs.com
2. Make an account if you don't already have one
3. Log in to your account
4. Click Sandbox in the upper right-hand corner
5. Put in a name, and click the button that says Create Program!
6. Click on HTML and press the button again

Here is a sample code for today. Remember, from now on, you will have to type this out yourself.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>


Try figuring out what each thing is before continuing forward.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Well <Doctype html> shows which version of HTML you're using, so others can add on to it, if they choose to.
The <head> section tells data about the webpage, but doesn't display anything, unless you add a <title> tag, which is the name you see in the browser tab.
The <body> tag shows what users will see on the actual website.
The <h1> tag is a heading tag, so the text in between <h1> and </h1> will be in the heading form of h1.
These go from <h1> to <h6>.
The <p> tag stands for paragraph. That will be just regular text.
The <hr> tag stands for Horizontal Line. It just makes a nice little divider in between your text.
Finally, the <html> tag is just everything in the website, from data to visible features.
Note that, all tags have an ending tag with a back slash. This shows the tag's jurisdiction, and that tag will not keep going after the ending tag.
the <hr> tag does not have an ending tag because no text is affected by it.
