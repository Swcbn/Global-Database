At the end of each file you make, please put "By - <i>your github user name</i>" or "- <i>your github user name</i>"

Please, when placing your file in the Global Database, be as specific with your file path as possible.
Ex. Global-Database/computer science/Web Devolpment and Design/HTML/Introduction to HTML

If there is already a path that you can put your file in and is relevant to the folder's name/subject, you may put it in those folders.
If part of the file path is relevant, but not all, you may extend that path.
Ex. You have a Python tutorial.
    There is a path to computer science, but not one to data science.
    You can make one.
    Like this -- Global-Database/computer science/Data Science/<i>Python tutorial name</i>

If you have any questions about file path managment, please contact swcbn at s201g@outlook.com.
You file path may be corrected or changed by swcbn if he thinks it can be more specific. You will be notified as soon as possible about these changes.

Lastly, please, if you contribute something to the Global Database, even if it is a path correction, enter your name (actual or github is fine) and email in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.

Thank you for supporting the Global Database, a database that grows with us.
